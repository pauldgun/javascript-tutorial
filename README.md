--Summary

## Chapter 1: Variables

- Variables are like boxes of memory that can contain data and we'll refer to that variable by the name we give it
- In JS, we have 3 ways to declare a variable: var, let and const
- let can reassign the value while const cannot

## Chapter 2: Data Types

- JS has many data types, some of them are strings, number, boolean and undefined/null
- Strings are letters, numbers, emojis, and any type of character you see on the keyboard
- Numbers can be positive, negative whole numbers, or even be numbers with decimals
- Boolean - the boolean type is strictly true or false
- Undefined usually means that there is no value and Null usually means that we are clearing out the value

## Chapter 3: Arrays

- Arrays are a data structure. A data structure is a way to organize your data to best serve you
- Arrays for us are going to be a way to store multiple values in the same variable
- We can store numbers, booleans, dates, objects, and so much more
- Arrays have a special way for you to access the individual values stored in that array
- 2 ways to add values to an array:

* Using []
* Using Push()

- To remove items, use the Pop() command

## Chapter 4: Functions

- Functions have a few goals:

* Help you organize your code for readability
* Allow you to take blocks of code and make them easily repeatable, thus reducing errors

- Anonymous functions: Are functions that have the same rules - they need an input, output and logic, but the major difference here is that we don't give these functions a name, hence anonymous.
- Callback: Are functions that can be used as inputs to another function
- Arrows Functions: Are just like standard functions, except for there's a bit of syntactic difference

## Chapter 5: Objects

- Objects are a special data type in JavaScript. They allow us to describe things with a lot of detail - the details are what we will call properties. The properties allow us to describe our objects
- Objects can also allow us to define functions or behavior
- In JavaScript, we can create objects in two main ways, object literals and classes
- Classes:

* Constructor: The constructor is just the rules that you need to create your class
* Constructor is like a special function, so it can have its inputs

## Chapter 6: Conditions

- Implement in file .js

## Chapter 7: Loops

- Loops allow us to repeat code over and over again
- For Loops: allow us to repeat code a set number of times. And that time is usually based on the condition
- While vs Do While:

* The important difference is that the do while loop will run at least once, whereas with the while loop, there's no guarantee that it will run at least once
